# Stress & Trauma

## Stress

Player characters in _Blades in the Timestream _ have a special reserve called **frag**. It’s a measure of your ability to endure the disruption time travel has wreaked on your personal timeline, and to summon the willpower and insight required to force further change upon the timeline.  When your character suffers a consequence that they don’t want to accept, they can take frag instead to instinctively reshape the recent past. The result of the **revision roll** determines how much stress it costs to avoid a bad outcome.

_During a gun fight, Julia’s character, Octavia, gets shot in the chest. Julia rolls her Rampancy rating to revise, and gets a \>2\. It costs 6 stress, minus 2 (the result of the resistance roll) to resist the consequences. Julia marks off 4 frag and describes how Octavia shifts her position in the timestream._

_The GM rules that the harm is reduced by the revision roll, but not avoided entirely. Octavia suffers level 2 harm (“Shoulder Wound”) instead of level 3 harm (“Punctured Lung”)._

## Pushing Yourself

You can use frag to push yourself for greater performance. For each bonus you choose below, take **2 frag** (each can be chosen once for a given action):

* Add **+1d** to your roll. (This may be used for an action roll or downtime roll or any other kind of roll where extra effort would help you)
* Add **+1 level** to your effect.
* Take action when you’re incapacitated.

## Trauma

When a PC marks their last frag box, they suffer a level of Paradox. When you take paradox, circle one of your **paradox conditions** like _untethered_, _twisted_, _paranoid_, etc. They’re all described on the next page.

When you suffer paradox, you’re taken out of action. You’re trapped in your own personal time fork or otherwise dropped out of the current conflict, only to come back later, shaken and drained. When you return, **you have zero frag** and your vice has been satisfied for the next downtime.

**Paradox conditions are permanent**. Your character acquires the new personality quirk indicated by the condition, and can earn xp by using it to cause trouble. **When you mark your fourth paradox condition**, your character cannot continue as a daring scoundrel. You must retire them to a different life or sacrifice them to oblivion to reduce the crew’s Divergence level.

### Paradox Conditions

* Untethered: You cannot tell which of your memories are real and which belong to lost timelines.
* Overwhelmed: You have too much information in your mind, and take time to sort through it.
* Cautious: You’re paranoid about causing paradox, and will be over-cautious with any time travel.
* Paranoid: Nothing can be relied upon. Anything might have been set up before your birth to bring you down.
* Fractured: A piece of you got left behind somehwere- it's hard to focus without it.
* Disengaged: You've got one foot in and one foot out of reality. Human concerns like suffering, empathy, and morality seem somehwat trivial in comparison.
* Stubborn: You prefer to remember things the way you remember them happening. Not how they actually happened.
* Forgetful: You only remember the most recent loop of a heist.
* Lost in Time: On a 1, you teleport forward or backward in time 1 hour for the next 5 minutes before returning back to where you were.
