List character ideas here.

# Seer
Overexposure to the timestream has given you an intuitive understanding of the warp and weft of history. You can sense which actions will create the most disruption, glimpse hundreds of thousands of possible futures, even anticipate the path of a bullet as it's being fired. These abilities should be used carefully, however, lest overwhelming visions of potential futures leave you insensate to the present.

# Reenactor
Years of pouring over historical texts alone and reenacting famous moments with your friends have given you an encyclopedic knowledge of history and a keen eye for small details. With your expertise (and maybe a touch of 36th century universal translation tech) you can blend seamlessly into any era you choose, and hopefully keep the rest of your squad (who can't even be bothered to use period-accurate buttons on their coats!) from standing out, too.

# Hopper
There's very few problems that can't be solved with a quick dip into the timestream. Locked door? Wasn't there 300 years ago. Staring down a hired killer? Take a quick trip to their childhood and convince them to take up painting instead. Sure, it can have unintended consequences, but it's just little changes- nobody will notice. Be careful about how much you jump around, though-- a misstep could get you stuck in the paleolithic, or worse: nowhen at all.

# Deviser
Time travel is a tricky concept to conceptualize into a science but you're pretty sure you've got it down. You know the principles of time travel and how to translate it from theory to reality. Basically, you maintain time travel machines and make sure everyone's cobbled-together future tech works no matter the time period. You have a knack for cannibalizing any tech to keep your devises working wherever you are because someone has to make sure everyone can actually travel.

# Wound
Anyone who partakes in time travel is daring at heart, flouting the normal laws of physics to traverse all of time and space. But sometimes, one just gets too close to the sun. If you take on too much Paradox, you have the option to not succumb and instead remain in existence. You become a walking wound in the timeline, a split on the skin of reality. This allows you access to powers beyond what a normal time traveller possess but beware: the more you flout reality, the more your true nature creeps to the surface.

# Primal
The simpler, the better. You're able to find useful tools in any situation, no matter how basic.

# Interdictor
Years of time travel experience has given you a leg up on others new to it. Once you are in a timestream, you are able to lock it and keep less experience time travelers others out.

# State of the Art (Temp name)
Having the newest and best equipment has its perks. When encountering any other traveler who relies on machinery for travel, on contact you can attempt to pass a rogue AI onto their machine that will temporarily take over and send them to a random time in history.
